# Z2SIX Mod License (Code + Assets)
Version 1.0 — Copyright (c) Z2SIX

This license governs use of the software code and the non-code creative works (“Assets”) contained in this repository and any official releases of the Mod.

If you do not agree to these terms, do not use, copy, modify, or distribute any part of the Mod.

## 1. Definitions

**“Z2SIX”** means the original author and copyright holder.

**“Mod”** means the project associated with this repository, including source code, build scripts, documentation, and any distributed binaries (e.g., JAR files), excluding third-party dependencies.

**“Code”** means the human-readable source code files and build logic that are authored by Z2SIX and included in this repository (e.g., `.java`, `.kt`, `.groovy`, `.gradle`, `.json` data/code-like files where applicable), plus any other files explicitly marked as Code by Z2SIX.

**“Assets”** means any non-Code content authored by Z2SIX, including (without limitation): textures, sprites, models, animations, sounds, music, voice, fonts, icons, UI art, images, videos, screenshots, promotional media, branding, names, logos, design elements, written lore, and other creative works. “Assets” includes any “look and feel” elements and audiovisual presentation, even if stored in formats used by the game (e.g., `.png`, `.ogg`, `.json` model files, lang files if they contain creative text, etc.). When in doubt, treat it as an Asset.

**“You”** means any individual or entity exercising rights under this license.

**“Derivative Work”** means a modified, adapted, or extended version of the Code, or a work based on the Code.

**“Official Mod Page”** means the Mod’s page on CurseForge or Modrinth as designated by Z2SIX.

**“Indistinguishable”** means a product (including a Derivative Work) that is likely to be confused by a reasonable user as being the Mod or an official fork of the Mod, including due to any combination of:
- same or confusingly similar mod name, logo, icon, branding, or promotional materials;
- same or confusingly similar mod id, namespace, package names, network identifiers, config identifiers, or update/telemetry endpoints;
- same or confusingly similar in-game UI/UX presentation, text, art style, screenshots, feature presentation, or “look and feel” associated with the Mod;
- presentation suggesting endorsement, authorship, or affiliation with Z2SIX that is not true.

## 2. Code License (Source-Available; permitted use with conditions)

Subject to your full compliance with this license, Z2SIX grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to:
- view, copy, and modify the Code;
- use the Code in personal, educational, free, or commercial projects;
- compile the Code and distribute compiled outputs of the Code as allowed below.

### 2.1. Conditions for using the Code

You must comply with all of the following:

**(A) No confusing products / no “running off” with the Mod**
- You may NOT Redistribute any Derivative Work of the Code as a stand-alone mod or mod project that is Indistinguishable from the Mod.
- You may NOT Redistribute a Derivative Work under the same mod name and/or mod id as the Mod.
- You may create private forks for development, debugging, learning, or contributing back, but public/redistributed forks must comply with Section 2.1(B) and must not be Indistinguishable.

**(B) Attribution when your product is NOT Indistinguishable**
If you Redistribute a Derivative Work or a product that includes or is based on the Code and it is NOT Indistinguishable, you must provide clear attribution that is reasonably visible to users, including:
- a “Credits” section in at least one of: the project README, repository page, published mod description page, or an in-game credits/about screen (when applicable);
- the statement: “Includes code from <Mod Name> by Z2SIX” (or equivalent wording);
- a link to the Official Mod Page OR the official source repository for the Mod.

**(C) No misrepresentation**
You may not state or imply that Z2SIX endorses, sponsors, or is responsible for your Derivative Work or product.

**(D) Bugfix forks and pull requests are allowed**
You may create a fork to fix bugs or make improvements and submit a pull request or patch back to Z2SIX. Such forks are allowed for the purpose of contribution; however, you must not Redistribute the fork as a competing product or as an Indistinguishable mod.

**(E) When in doubt**
If you are uncertain whether your use or distribution would be Indistinguishable or would violate this license, you must contact Z2SIX and obtain written permission before Redistributing. If a dispute arises and you did not seek permission while uncertainty existed, you agree to immediately stop redistribution upon notice from Z2SIX (see Section 6).

## 3. Asset License (All Rights Reserved)

All Assets are **All Rights Reserved** by Z2SIX unless Z2SIX explicitly states otherwise in writing (for example, in a mod description, a separate LICENSE file, or an explicit per-asset note).

You may NOT, without explicit written permission from Z2SIX:
- copy, extract, reproduce, trace, or otherwise use Assets;
- modify, remix, adapt, translate, or create derivative works of Assets;
- redistribute or re-host Assets, whether standalone or bundled (including inside other mods, resource packs, modpacks, websites, launchers, or “asset libraries”);
- use Assets (or confusingly similar versions) in your own projects, whether free or commercial.

**When in doubt, treat it as an Asset and do not use it without permission.**

---

## 4. Redistribution of the unmodified Mod (Modpacks, launchers, mirrors)

Z2SIX permits Redistributing the Mod (official releases, unmodified) in modpacks, launchers, blogs, and third-party apps, provided that all of the following are true:

1) **Link-back required:** You must include a working link to the Official Mod Page (CurseForge or Modrinth) in the modpack/launcher listing, blog post, or distribution page in a reasonably visible location.

2) **No paywall / no monetization tied to access (strict):**
You may not sell, rent, license, or otherwise monetize access to the Mod, whether directly or indirectly. This includes (without limitation):
- charging money to download a modpack that includes the Mod;
- offering “premium” or “donator-only” access where the Mod is part of what is accessed;
- requiring payment, subscriptions, tips, donations, Patreon tiers, “supporter” roles, server ranks, or any other transaction to access content where the Mod is included as a component;
- gating servers, worlds, content, or features behind payment when the Mod is part of that offering.

If your project involves money in any way and the Mod is included, assume it is not permitted unless Z2SIX grants written permission.

3) **Do not claim authorship:** You must not claim you made the Mod or that the Mod is your work.

4) **Do not distribute Assets separately:** You may distribute the Mod as a whole, but not extract and redistribute Assets separately.

## 5. Third-party dependencies

This license does not grant any rights to third-party libraries, APIs, tooling, or dependencies. Those components remain under their own licenses. You are responsible for compliance with them.

---

## 6. Enforcement, termination, and compliance

**Automatic termination:** Any violation of this license automatically terminates all rights granted to you under this license immediately.

**Cease and desist:** Upon notice from Z2SIX (including a message on a hosting platform, issue tracker, email, or other reasonable contact method), you must promptly:
- stop Redistributing the Mod, Derivative Works, and/or any prohibited use of Assets;
- remove infringing content from distribution where you control it;
- cease using Z2SIX branding in any way that causes confusion.

**Reinstatement:** Reinstatement, if any, is solely at Z2SIX’s discretion and must be explicit and in writing.
