## About

EZActions is a **client-side utility mod** that introduces a circular (radial) quick-access menu. Players can map any in-game keybind, mod keybind, or console command into an intuitive layout, ideal for complex modpacks or fast gameplay.

Use it to:
- Group your most-used commands or abilities.
- Trigger actions with one motion instead of multiple key presses.
- Organize actions into nested categories (bundles).
- Create custom menu layouts that persist between sessions.
